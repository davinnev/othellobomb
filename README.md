Game Description: <br/>
Othello is a two-player strategy board game played on a square uncheckered board. Players will take turns placing disks on the board (beginning with the player who has the black disc). Any disk of the opponent's color that is bounded by the current player's disk in the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal will be flipped over to the current player's color. When the board is full, the game is over. At the end of the game, the player with the most disks with his assigned color facing up is declared the winner. In this Othello game, there is a slight modification where there will be bombs placed on the map at random, which may benefit or harm the players.
